# Lotka-Volterra-Predator-Prey-Model-Simulation-and-Analysis
Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Model Simulation This project simulates and analyzes the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, representing the interaction between predator and prey populations. It explores system dynamics through numerical methods and visualizes population trends over time using Python and Sage Math.
